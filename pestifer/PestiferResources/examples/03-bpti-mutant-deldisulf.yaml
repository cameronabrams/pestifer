# Simple build of solvated BPTI 
#
# Notes:
#   - The phospate ion is excluded
#   - All crystal waters are retained
#   - Some selected mutations are performed, showcasing two 
#     shortcode formats
#   - A disulfide is removed
#   - A four-phase NPT equilibration is used to settle the density
#   - A production tarball is generated: prod_6pti.tgz
