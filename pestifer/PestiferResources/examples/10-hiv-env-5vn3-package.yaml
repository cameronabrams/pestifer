# Simple build of solvated HIV-1 Env trimer 5vn3
#
# Notes:
#   - Missing protein is built-in
#   - Fab and sCD4 chains excluded
#   - Missing V1/2 residues in each gp120 replaced with GGG
#   - A four-phase NPT equilibration is used to settle the density
#   - A production tarball is generated: prod_5vn3.tgz
