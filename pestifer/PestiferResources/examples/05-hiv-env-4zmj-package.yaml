# Simple build of solvated HIV-1 Env SOSIP ectodomain trimer 4zmj
#
# Notes:
#   - Missing protein is built-in
#   - Fine-tuning ramachandran rotations performed at N-terminus of HN1
#     to avoid steric clashes when building in these missing residues
#   - A four-phase NPT equilibration is used to settle the density
#   - A production tarball is generated: prod_4zmj.tgz
