# Simple build of solvated hexameric insulin 2ins
#
# Notes:
#   - All waters are removed from the input PDB file
#   - The Zn-bound histidines are patched to HSE from default HSD
#     based on content of LINK records in the PDB file
#   - A five-phase NPT equilibration is used to settle the density
#   - A production tarball is generated: prod_2ins.tgz
