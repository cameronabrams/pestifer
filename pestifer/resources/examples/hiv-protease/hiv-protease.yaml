# Build of solvated HIV protease 
#
# Notes:
#   - Using the 1f7a pdb entry
#   - The ligand (chain P) is removed
#   - ASPP patch to protonate ASP25 (catalytic residue)
#   - Acetates (ACT) are included by providing psfgen 
#     with segment type information and the appropriate
#     aliases to map to the CHARMM36 ACET residue.
