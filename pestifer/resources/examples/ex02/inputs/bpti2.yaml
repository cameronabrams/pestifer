# Simple build of solvated BPTI (mimics psfgen user manual)
#
# Notes:
#   - The phospate ion is excluded, but all crystal waters are retained
#   - Solution has 0.154 M NaCl
#   - A five-phase NPT equilibration is used to settle the density
#   - A production tarball is generated: prod_6pti.tgz rooted in directory ready-to-run
