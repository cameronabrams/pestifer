# Simple build of solvated HIV-1 Env trimer 8fad
#
# Notes:
#   - Missing protein is built-in
#   - Drug molecules (resname 83G) is included (previously parameterized using cgenff)
#   - mmCIF input file requires careful attention to chainIDs and
#     residue numbers
#   - Fine-tuning ramachandran rotations performed to avoid steric
#     clashes when building in missing residues
#   - A five-phase NPT equilibration is used to settle the density
#   - A production tarball is generated: prod_8fad.tgz
