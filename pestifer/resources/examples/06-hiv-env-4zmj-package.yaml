# Simple build of solvated HIV-1 Env SOSIP ectodomain trimer 4zmj
#
# Notes:
#   - Chain G produces daughter chains H and J upon BIOMT transformation to build trimer
#   - Chain B produces daughter chains C and D upon BIOMT transformation to build trimer
#   - Existing chains C and D (these are glycans) are assigned new chainIDs
#   - All glycans are assigned chainIDs that are not shared with any protein
#   - Missing protein is built-in
#   - Fine-tuning ramachandran rotations performed at N-terminus of HN1
#     to avoid steric clashes when building in these missing residues
#   - A five-phase NPT equilibration is used to settle the density
#   - A production tarball is generated: prod_4zmj.tgz
