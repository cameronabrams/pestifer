# Simple build of solvated HIV-1 Env trimer 7txd
#
# Notes:
#   - Missing protein is built-in
#   - mmCIF input file requires careful attention to chainIDs and
#     residue numbers
#   - Fab and sCD4 chains excluded
#   - zero-occupancy residues at C-terminus of each gp41 are built
#     and folded into an alpha-helix
#   - Missing V1/2 residues in each gp120 replaced with GGG
#   - A five-phase NPT equilibration is used to settle the density
#   - A production tarball is generated: prod_7txd.tgz
