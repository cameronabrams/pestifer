CHARMM Element doc/drude.doc $Revision: 1.1.1.1 $File: DRUDE, Node: Top, Next: Syntax, Up: (chmdoc/commands.doc)         Polarizable Drude Oscillator Formatby  Benoit Roux      (roux@uchicago.edu)and Guillaume Lamoureux  (Guillaume.Lamoureux@umontreal.ca)and Alex MacKerell Jr.   (alex@outerbanks.umaryland.edu)Classical drude particles are generated for all atoms for whichpolarizabilities (ie. via the ALPHA keyword) are specified in the RTFfile.  This allows for the drudes to be generated automatically when amolecule is generated in CHARMM (only the heavy atoms carry apolarizability in the current force field but the code is general andallows assigning a polarizability to any atom including hydrogens). Inaddition, code has been developed to allow for inclusion of atom-basedThole scale factors, atom-based anisotropic polarizabilities and theaddition of lone pairs to selected atoms at the RTF level. Thesecapabilities allow for all the information for the polarizable Drudeforce field to be included in the RTF and parameter files. Thisimplementation replaces the old "Drude Oscillator Command" and"ANISOTROPY keyword" (see below) used to generate the Drudepolarizable model prior to July 2007.For each atom with a specified polarizability, a "Drude oscillator" iscreated by attaching to the atom an additional particle (using afictitious chemical bond of length zero and of force constant 'KDRUDE= k/2'). Each Drude particle is given a mass and a charge, taken fromthe mass and the charge of its atom (so that the total mass and chargeare conserved for the "atom-Drude" pair).As a whole, each "atom-Drude" pair carries a total charge 'q',unchanged From the partial charge the non-polarizable atom had priorto calling the DRUDE command during system generation. The"atom-Drude" pair forms a dipole 'q*d', where 'q' is the charge on theDrude particle and 'd' is the displacement vector going from the atomto its Drude particle.  Any external electrostatic field 'E' creates anet displacement 'd = q*E/k', and thus the "atom-Drude" pair behavesas a point charge 'q' with a polarizability 'alpha = q**2/k'. Thepolarizabilities (in Angst**3) are specified with the ALPHA command inthe RTF, along with the THOLE factors (see below), and converted intocharges 'q', assuming a force constant 'k = 2*KDRUDE', where KDRUDE isspecified in the parameter file (see below); a value of 500 shouldalways be used.See J. Chem. Phys. 119, 3025-3039 (2003) for more details.In the Drude treatment of polarization the force constant of thespring between the atom-Drude pair is a diagonal rank-2 tensor withcomponents KDRUDE. This leads to an isotropic atomic polarizability,'alpha = alpha_{11} = alpha_{22} = alpha_{33} = q**2/k'. TheANISOTROPY command, which is typically included in the RTF, modifiesthe components of the Drude force constant tensor allowing foranisotropic atomic polarizabilites.See J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2, 1587-1597 (2006) for more details.The bonded lists are modified so that, if the "real" atoms are in a1-2, 1-3, or 1-4 relationship, their corresponding Drude particleswill also be in a 1-2, 1-3, or 1-4 relationship, respectively.For a single atom (charges in parenthesis):      DRUDE A  -------->  A~DA For a diatomic molecule: A1   DRUDE    A1~DA1 |   -------->   | A2            A2~DA21-2 pairs: A1-A2, A1-DA2, DA1-A2, DA1-DA2For a triatomic molecule: A1              A1~DA1  \      DRUDE    \   A2  -------->   A2~DA2  /               / A3              A3~DA31-2 pairs: A1-A2, A1-DA2, DA1-A2, DA1-DA2,           A2-A3, A2-DA3, DA2-A3, DA2-DA31-3 pairs: A1-A3, A1-DA3, DA1-A3, DA1-DA3Thus, the bonded interactions are modified to allow 1-2 and 1-3screened dipole-dipole interactions, as proposed by Thole [seeChem.Phys. 59, 341 (1981)]. If two atoms were not "seeing" each othersin the non-polarizable force field, their dipoles (and only theirdipoles, not their net partial charges) will "see" each others in thepolarizable force field. The screening function strength is modulatedby a parameter "a" that has been generalized to depend on the atomtype associated with the interacting pair of Drude oscillators and arethen generated via a standard arithmetic combination rule (a = a_i +a_j).  These variable atomic THOLE parameters "a_i" are specified inthe RTF through the THOLE keyword.* Menu:* Description:: Description of new DRUDE model RTF      Description of new DRUDE model RTF1) Items in RTF fileA) The AUTOGENERATE command now includes a flag for the drudeparticles. This should be specified at the beginning of the RTF.AUTO ANGLES DIHE DRUDEB) MASS statements must be included for Drude particle types.MASS  104 DRUD   0.00000 DD ! drude particleThe default drude type is DRUD. However, alternate drude types may bespecified. These additional drude types must be i) specified with MASSstatements, ii) the ATOMs to which they are applied must include a"TYPE drudetype" statement and iii) the NONBond parameters must bespecified. For example, to include a special drude type on water thefollowing would be needed in the RTFi)  MASS  153 DOH2   0.00000 DD ! water Drudeii) ATOM  OH2 ODW   0.00000 ALPHA -0.97825258 TYPE DOH2iii) (NONBOND section)  D*    0.0  -0.0000  0.0000                              ! Wildcard for Drudes and dummy atomiv) (via NBFIX) MAGD  DOH2  -0.01000 3.10000Term iv) is an NBFIX that allows for the interactions between, forexample, magnesium and the water drude to be treated with a special LJterm. Indeed, the motivation for additional drude types are suchspecial terms may be applied in special cases. Note that NBFIX termshave been used between select real atoms in the Drude force field toimprove the free energies of hydration.See J. Chem. Theory Comput. 6. 1181-1198 (2010) for more details.C) ALPHA and THOLE parameters are set in the RTF after the charge.The presence of the "ALPHA" keyword flags that atom as beingpolarizable and a drude particle is created and assigned to it whencalling the GENERATE command. An atom based Thole scale factor mayalso be specified via the "THOLE" keyword.  If the THOLE term ismissing, a default value of 1.3 is assigned to that atom. Thiscorresponds to a parameter a = a_i + a_j = 2.6 which is the THOLEparameter in the old Drude command syntax.ATOM C  C   0.630 ALPHA -1.104 THOLE 1.073Note that a negative sign on alpha leads to the charge on the Drude particle to be negative. This convention was chosen because the Drudes are meant torepresent electronic degrees of freedom of the system.D) Specific drude types for a polarizable atom may be specified asfollows using the "TYPE" keyword. See 1A) above, sections i to iv formore details.ATOM C  C   0.630 ALPHA -1.104 TYPE DCE) Lone pairs may now be set directly in the RTF using a syntaxsimilar to the standard lonepair command (lonepair.doc). All optionsfor the generation of lonepairs (FIXed, CENTer, COLOcate etc.) asspecified in the lonepair documentation may be used although the atomselection specification is simplified as shown in the followingexample.LONEPAIR relative LPA O C CL distance 0.3 angle 91.0 dihe 0.0LONEPAIR relative LPB O C N  distance 0.3 angle 91.0 dihe 0.0F) Atom based anisotropic polarizabilities may be assigned to selectedatoms via the ANISOTROPY keyword in the RTF. The anisotropicpolarizability tensor is defined as ALPHA_iso (the isotropicpolarizability) times a tensor A whith trace{A}=3. The tensor A isdiagonal in the local reference frame and is completely specified by{A11, A22, A33}. The first atom selects the atom on which thepolarizability is to be made anisotropic. The second atom along withthe first defines the "11" direction of the {A} tensor and the 3rd and4th atom selections define the "22" direction of the tensor, with theanisotropy defined by fractional polarizability components.Accordingly, only the 11 and 22 direction are needed since the traceof the {A} tensor is set to 3. An example followsANISOTROPY O C CA N A11 0.6968 A22 1.2194In the code, the variables A11 and A22 are read into the variablesA11ANIS(IPT) and A22ANIS(IPT). We define the components of the tensorrelative to the isotropic drude, so ALPHA11+ALPHA22+ALPHA33 =3*ALPHA_iso. The factors A11 and A22 (and A33) represent the factorsmodifying the components of the isotropic polarizability tensorq**2/KDRUDE. For example, setting A11=A22=1 would keep the Drudecompletely isotropic. By virtue of the trace we know thatA11+A22+A33=3, so we only need to set two of these terms. Thus A33 =THREE-A11ANIS(IPT)-A22ANIS(IPT). This sets the relative magnitude ofthe polarizability tensor in all 3 directions.Once the polarizability along a given direction is known, we need toget the harmonic force constant in this direction. As thepolarizability in a given direction is defined asQDRUDE**2/K_direction, the 3 harmonic force constants are thus       K11(NANISO) = ONE/A11ANIS(IPT)       K22(NANISO) = ONE/A22ANIS(IPT)       K33(NANISO) = ONE/A33Now, in principle this would mean that you have to calculate theforces from 3 different springs (K11, K22, K33) in 3 differentdirections. But since we know the overall trace which is related tothe isotropic polarizability, we are going to re-write this so thatthere are only 2 springs with force constants KPAR in the parallel andKPERP in the perpendicular direction, and add an isotropic KDRUDEspring on top of that.2) Items in the Parameter fileA) The KDRUDE force constant for all the atoms is set by a wildcard inthe bond parameters. The term must be included for all drude typesincluded in the model. The wildcard terms can be overwritten byputting chemical type specific bond parameters following the wild cardterm.DRUD X   500.000   0.0000DRUD O   487.740   0.0000B) NONBOND parameters must be included for all drude types. Inaddition, NBFIX terms for the drudes may be included as needed (see 1Aabove).C) A pair-specific Thole shielding can be introduced in the parameterfile for any nonbond pair (following a syntax similar to NBFIX) usingthe keyword THOLe. This feature was introduced to permit accuratemodels of divalent cations with polarizable atoms. The TCUT assigns aradius within which all Thole interaction are calculated between thespecificed atoms. The 'aij' typically is assigned by the user. Adefault value 1.2 can also be used.THOLE TCUT 5.0 MAXNBTHOLE 50000CL SODD @aij3) Command Line ItemsA) A "DRUDE" flag must be included with the GENErate command tospecify the inclusion of drudes on the molecule. The drude mass is setin this command using the DMASS keyword followed by the mass in AMU; avalue of 0.4 is highly suggested.generate NMA first none last none setup warn DRUDE DMASS 0.4An additional command that may be included with the generate commandis the HYPErpolarizability term. This command invokes a higherexponent half-wall potential on the Drude particles to minimize thepotential for polarization catastrophe. In the HYPEpolarzation commandHORD is the order of the exponent, KHYP is the force constant and RHYPrepresent atom-Drude distance at which the hypepolarization term isinvoked. An example of the command follows. Note that if DrudeHardWall, as described in the following section, isused HYPErpolarization is not required. Experience with severalsystems suggest that the DrudeHardWall feature is a more effective waythan HYPER to generate stable simulations with a 1 fs timesteps.generate NMA first none last none setup warn DRUDE DMASS 0.4 HYPE HORD 4 KHYP 40000 RHYP 0.2B) DrudeHardWall command by  Lei Huang      (lhuang3@uchicago.edu)and Benoit Roux     (roux@uchicago.edu)When the Drude particles move far away from the nucleus (eg. > 0.2Ang.), simulations become unstable and polarization catastrophe mayoccur. Introducing hard wall constraints on the length of Drude-nucleibonds is a way to avoid such instability. In each MD step, the lengthof Drude bonds are checked and compared with "L_WALL". When the lengthof a Drude bond is larger than "L_WALL", the relative velocities alongbond vector are flipped and scaled down according to the temperatureof the drude bond. In addition, the displacement relative to "L_WALL"is flipped and scaled down according to new velocities along the bondvector to make sure the Drude bond is not longer than "L_WALL".DrudeHardWall L_WALL realExample: DrudeHardWall L_WALL 0.2! set the hard wall at 0.2 AngstromDrudeHardWall L_WALL 0.0! turn off the hard wall when L_WALL equals 0.0    Description of Extended PSF format for CHARMM and NAMDThe PSF has been extended for the Drude model. The default format isfor CHARMM and the XPLOR format is for NAMD. The PSF followinggeneration of the Drude model explicitly provides the THOLE, ALPHA,lone pair and anisotropic polarization information for CHARMM/NAMD PSFreader. * Menu:* Syntax::      Syntax of the DRUDE command* Description:: Description of the DRUDE command* Toppar::      Effect on the topology and parameters* Warnings::    To be aware of when using the DRUDE command* Examples::    Usage examples of the DRUDE commandFile: DRUDE, Node: Syntax, Previous: Top, Next: Description, Up: Top      Syntax of the DRUDE commandDRUDe RESEtGENErate { generate-spec } DRUDe [DMASS real] [KDRUde real] [HYPE] { hype-spec }generate-spec::= [see struct.doc]File: DRUDE, Node: Description, Previous: Syntax, Next: Toppar, Up: Top      Description of the DRUDE command-------------------------------------------------------------------Keyword Default  Purpose-------------------------------------------------------------------RESET          Deactivates the Drude particles.

Itoverrides any bond constant found in the parameter file. For highlypolar molecules like water, the recommended value for KDRUDE is 500kcal/mol/Angst**2.The atomic polarizabilities (in Angst**3) may be read from the WMAINarray:   alpha = abs(WMAIN)The charge on every Drude particle is computed using the followingformula:  q = sqrt( 2*KDRUDE * alpha / CCELEC ) * sign(WMAIN)The charges are given the signs of the WMAIN values. As long as KDRUDEis large enough, the Drude particles will stay very close to theiratoms, and the sign of 'q' is irrelevant. However, as the Druderepresents the electronic degrees of freedom, the sign of alpha is setto a negative value, thereby yielding a negative charge on the Drudeparticles.-------------------------------------------------------------------2) THOLE, SHAPE(For 1-2 and 1-3 atoms only. All other interactions are regularCoulomb.) See THOLE keywords in the parameter file to perform Tholescaling between nonbonded atoms.The THOLE parameter is a dimensionless factor that specifies theextent of the smearing of the charge 'q' on the Drude oscillators andof a contribution '-q' on the "real" atom. The default value of THOLEis 2.6, that is, the 1-2 and 1-3 dipole-dipole interactions are turnedon by default. To turn the interactions off, set THOLE to zero.The default constant THOLE of 2.6 can be replaced by variable tholeparameters using the VTHOLE keyword on the DRUDE command line or,more, comonly, by specifying an atom specific Thole value in thetopology file. The THOLE parameter between oscillators I and J isgiven by THOLE = THOLEI + THOLEJ. Values of THOLEI may also be givenin the WCOMP array for all Drude oscillator containing atoms prior tothe DRUDE command.Because the dipole are explicitly made of two charges, the screeneddipole-dipole interaction between two polarizable atoms (that is, two"atom-Drude" pairs) is actually the sum of the following four screenedcharge-charge interactions:  ('q1' on Drude 1) - ('q2' on Drude 2)  ('q1' on Drude 1) - ('-q2' on atom 2)  ('-q1' on atom 1) - ('q2' on Drude 2)  ('-q1' on atom 1) - ('-q2' on atom 2)The screened charge-charge interaction has the form:  U(r12) = CCELEC * q1*q2 * S(u12)/r12where 'u12' is the normalized distance:  u12 = r12 * THOLE / (alpha1*alpha2)**(1/6)'S' is a screening function defined by the SHAPE parameter:  SHAPE  Screening function       Charge distributions   1    S(u) = 1 - (1+u/2)*exp(-u)   Slater-Delta   2    S(u) = erf(u)          GaussianThe default value of SHAPE is 1, which is also the only shapecurrently implemented. SHAPE=2 is reserved for Gaussian-Gaussiandistributions.Two "atom-Drude" pairs have dipole-dipole interactions if thefollowing conditions are met:  1. The THOLE parameter is nonzero.  2. In the non-polarizable force field, the two atoms were    in the nonbonded exclusion list.To see if all the desired atoms have dipole-dipole interactions, usePRNLEV > 7. Each call to the energy will print the atom numbers,polarizabilities and Drude particles's charges of each interactingpair.The energy from the dipole-dipole interactions is added to the ELECenergy term, and "SKIP ELEC" will skip the Thole interactions as well.File: DRUDE, Node: Toppar, Previous: Description, Next: Warnings, Up: Top      Effect on the topology and parameters-------------------------------------------------------------------1) New atomsThe Drude particles are inserted immediately after their correspondingatoms in the PSF and coordinate file. For an atom type 'CA1', theDRUDE command will assign the atom type 'DCA1' for the Drude particle.Since no regular atoms have names starting with a 'D', the Drudeoscillators can be selected with "SELECT TYPE D* END".-------------------------------------------------------------------2) MassesThe masses for the selected atoms are modified so that the total massof the atom-Drude pair corresponds to the atomic mass. Try "SCALARMASS SHOW" before and after calling the DRUDE command.-------------------------------------------------------------------3) ChargesThe charges for the selected atoms are modified so that the totalcharge of the atom-Drude pair corresponds to the atomic partialcharge. Try "SCALAR CHARGE SHOW" before and after calling the DRUDEcommand.-------------------------------------------------------------------4) Bonded interactionsIn addition to the atom-Drude bonds, zero force bonds are createdbetween the atom-Drude pairs to maintain the same 1-2, 1-3, and 1-4relationships that existed prior to the DRUDE call. For example, fortwo bonded atoms A1 and A2, with Drude particles DA1 and DA2,  DA1       DA2   |        |   A1 ----- A2zero force bonds are created between DA1 and DA2, between DA1 and A2,and between A1 and DA2, so that any particle of the A1-DA1 pair is 1-2bonded to any particle of the A2-DA2 pair. Since the force constantsof these fictitious bonds are zero, the computational overhead isminimal.-------------------------------------------------------------------5) Non-bonded interactionsWhether the Drude particles have Lennard-Jones parameters or not, theLennard-Jones parameters of the selected atoms are kept unchanged.Since the polarizable force field is built from the same "ingredients"as the non-polarizable force field, all the NBONDS options can be usedas before (notably the PMEWALD method).File: DRUDE, Node: Warnings, Previous: Toppar, Next: Examples, Up: Top      Issues to be aware of when using the DRUDE command-------------------------------------------------------------------1) Once all molecules in the system have been generated and any patchingperformed, invoke the following commands to create the drude and lone paircoordinates and set up the needed arrays.COOR SDRUDECOOR SHAKE-------------------------------------------------------------------2) The preferred call to SHAKE is:COOR COPY COMPSHAKE BONH PARAM TOLERANCE 10E-9 -   NOFAST -   SELECT .NOT.

Introducing hardwall constraint on the length of Drude-nuclei bonds is a possible wayto avoid such instability. In each MD step, the length of Drude bondsare checked and compared with "L_WALL". When the length of Drude bondis larger than "L_WALL", the relative velocities along bond vector areflipped and scaled down according to the temperature of Drude bond. Inaddition, the displacement relative to "L_WALL" is flipped and scaleddown according to new the velocities along bond the vector to make suredrude bond is not longer than "L_WALL".File: DRUDE, Node: Examples, Previous: Warnings, Next: Top, Up: Top      Usage examples of the DRUDE command-------------------------------------------------------------------1) Polarizable benzene  (see test/c30test/drude_benzene.inp)After reading the standard, non-polarizable topology and parameterfiles, a standard benzene molecule is generated:  READ SEQUENCE BENZ 1  GENERATE BENZ SETUP FIRST NONE LAST NONE DRUDE DMASS 0.4Obtain the benzene coordinates using IC build or reading in thecoordinates.

Thestrong anisotropy comes from the 1-2 and 1-3 dipole-dipoleinteractions. Deactivating these interactions by using THOLE=0 leadsto the polarizability tensor being almost isotropic.-------------------------------------------------------------------2) SWM4-NDP water  (see test/c30test/swm4.inp)See J.
