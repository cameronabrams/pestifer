  title: Configuration File Reference
  text: |
    Pestifer uses YAML-format configuration input for executing a build.  These pages document all YAML directives 
    that can be included in a config file.  You can also use the ``pestifer config-help`` subcommand to step through
    this documentation on interactively on the command line.

    Each item below is a top-level directive in a pestifer configuration file.
directives:
  - name: charmmff
    type: dict
    text: Specifications for charmm force-field parameter and topology files
    required: True
    docs:
      text: |
        The ``charmff`` directive informs pestifer which CHARMM force-field parameter and topology files are to be 
        used for all psfgen/namd3 executions.  ``standard`` refers to files that are found in the official CHARMMFF 
        release, and are referred to by their base filenames, regardless of whether they live in the topmost ``toppar`` 
        directory or one of the stream subdirectories.  ``custom`` refers to files that are not part of the official CHARMMFF release.
    directives:
      - name: tarball
        type: str
        text: Path to a tarball containing the charmmff files; this is used to override the default set of charmmff files
      - name: standard
        type: dict
        text: Standard charmmff files under the standard ``toppar/`` directory
        required: True
        docs:
          text: |
            These are the standard CHARMM force-field files that pestifer will use for all psfgen/namd3 executions.  
            These files are included in the pestifer distribution, and are not expected to be modified by the user.  
            They are always referred to by their base filenames, regardless of whether they live in the topmost ``toppar`` 
            directory or one of the stream subdirectories.  The default set is useful for most non-membrane systems.
        directives:
          - name: topologies
            type: list
            text: Standard charmmff topologies

      - name: pdbcollections
        type: list
        text: Paths to local collections of PDB files for custom lipids or ligands
        docs:
          text: | 
            Here you can list one or more paths to PDB collections that you have built using the ``make-pdb-collection`` subcommand.  
            These collections can be used to provide custom lipids or ligands for your simulations.  
            The paths should point to directories that contain subdirectories for each RESI in the collection, 
            each of which contains PDB files for that RESI.
          example: 
            charmff:
              pdbcollections:
                - /path/to/my/custom/lipid/collection/

    required: True
    directives:

        type: dict
        text: Dictionary for holding segment types as keys and lists of residue names as values
        docs:
          text: |
            This is a dictionary that holds segment types as keys and lists of residue names as values.  The segment types are used to define the segments in the PSF file, and the residue names are used to define the residues in each segment.
            The segment types are defined in the ``pestifer/core/labels.py`` file, and can be modified/appended to by the user using this directive.
      - name: aliases
        type: dict

                This is a list of atom aliases to add to psfgen.  The original list of aliases used by Pestifer is in core/labels.py. Each alias should be a string in the format "ATOM_NAME ALIAS_NAME", where ATOM_NAME is the name of the atom in the PDB file and ALIAS_NAME is the name you want to use in the PSF file.
          - name: residue

                    For example, A_1304:4b7i,C_1-8 grafts residues 1 to 8 of chain C of PDB entry 4b7i onto residue 1304 of chain A.
                    If the source PDB does not contain the specified residues, they will be skipped.

                    In the example below, the first graft can be interpreted as, "Take resids 1 to 8 of chain C of PDB 4b7i and graft them onto resid 1304 of chain A of the main molecule."  This will compute positions of the 8 residues by aligning the graft's resid 1 onto the main molecule's resid 1304 of chain A, and then replacing the coordinates of resid 1304 with that of resid 1 of the graft, and inserting the remaining 7 glycan residues into the main molecule topology.
                  example:
                      grafts:
                        - A_1304:4b7i,C_1-8

            During a psfgen task, pestifer can be configured to "cap" the ends of interior gaps in protein backbones, or it can model-in the missing residues by growing them in from the C-terminus of the resolved protein before the gap.  Ligation refers to forming the bond between the C-terminus of the modeled-in residues and the first resolved residue after the gap.  This is done by "steering" the C-terminus toward the first resolved residue after the gap and then patching the bond in using the CHARMMFF LINK patch.
