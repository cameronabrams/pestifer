This package provides classes and methods for handling CHARMM force field files. It interfaces directly with the tarballed CHARMM force field in its freshly downloaded state, stored in the :mod:`pestifer.resources` subpackage. It includes functionality for handling atom types, residues, and patches.  It also provides capabilities for generating PDB files for residues like lipids for use in membrane-packing using packmol.
