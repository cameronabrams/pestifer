"""
Tasks that can be executed by the Pestifer framework.
This package contains various task classes that define the operations to be performed during the execution of a Pestifer run.
Each task is responsible for a specific part of the workflow, such as building molecules, running simulations, and processing results.

Each module defines a specific task class that inherits from the base :class:`BaseTask <pestifer.core.basetask.BaseTask>` class.
