vmd:
    Path for vmd executable
    type: str
    default: /usr/local/bin/vmd
tasks:
    Specifies the tasks to be performed serially
    type: list
    Help available for psfgen, ligate, domainswap, solvate, md, manipulate, terminate
tasks->
psfgen:
    Parameters controlling a psfgen run on an input molecule
    type: dict
    Help available for source, mods, cleanup
tasks->
psfgen->
source:
    Specifies the source of the initial coordinate file
    type: dict
    Help available for id, biological_assembly, file_format, cif_residue_map_file, psf, altcoords, exclude, sequence
tasks->
psfgen->
source->
id:
    The 4-character PDB ID of the source or the basename of a local
      coordinate file (PDB or mmCIF format); pestifer will download
      from the RCSB if a file is not found
    type: str
    A value is required.
tasks->
psfgen->
source->
file_format:
    either PDB or mmCIF; some entries do not have a PDB-format file.  The
      main advantage of PDB is that it uses the author-designations
      for chains by default.  mmCIF is the new "default" format of the
      PDB.
    type: str
    default: PDB
    allowed values: PDB, mmCIF
tasks->
psfgen->
source->
sequence:
    Parameters controlling sequence modifications based on specifications
      in the PDB source

tasks->
psfgen->
source->
sequence->
fix_conflicts:
    Specifies whether or not sequence differences w.r.t. a sequence
      database and which are labeled as "conflicts"s are reverted to
      their database values
    type: bool
    default: True
tasks->
psfgen->
source->
sequence->
loops:

loops->
min_loop_length:
    Minimum length of model-built loop that triggers the ligation
      algorithm
    type: int

ligate:
    Specifies how C-termini of modeled loops are connected back to the
      protein
    type: dict
    Help available for steer, connect
tasks->
ligate->

    Specifies parameters for steered MD to bring C-termini close to their
      connection points

    type: dict
    Help available for ensemble, minimize, nsteps, dcdfreq, xstfreq, temperature, pressure, other_parameters, constraints
tasks->
md->
ensemble:
    Name of ensemble to run in; note that NPT can only be peformed on a
      solvated system
