    Help available for title, paths, tasks
title:
    Meaningful title (optional)
    type: str

paths:
    Allows user to specify various paths
    type: dict
    Help available for namd2, charmrun, vmd, charmmff
paths->
vmd:
    Path for vmd executable
    type: str
    default: /usr/local/bin/vmd
tasks:
    Specifies the tasks to be performed; each is a dictionary with a
      heading which is a reserved task name
    type: list
    Help available for psfgen, ligate, solvate, relax, terminate
tasks->
psfgen:
    Parameters controlling initial psfgen run
    type: dict
    Help available for source, mods, minimize, cleanup
tasks->
psfgen->
source:
    Specifies the source of the initial coordinate file
    type: dict
    Help available for id, biological_assembly, file_format, psf, exclude, sequence
tasks->
psfgen->
source->
id:
    The 4-character PDB ID of the source or the basename of a local
      coordinate file (PDB or mmCIF format); pestifer will download
      from the RCSB if a file is not found
    type: str
    A value is required.
tasks->
psfgen->
source->
file_format:
    either PDB or mmCIF; some entries do not have a PDB-format file.  The
      main advantage of PDB is that it uses the author-designations
      for chains by default.  mmCIF is the new "default" format of the
      PDB.
    type: str
    default: PDB
    allowed values: PDB, mmCIF

psfgen->
source->
sequence:
    Parameters controlling sequence modifications based on specifications
      in the PDB source
    type: dict

tasks->
psfgen->
source->
sequence->
fix_conflicts:
    Specifies whether or not sequence differences w.r.t. a sequence
      database and which are labeled as "conflicts"s are reverted to
      their database values
    type: bool
    default: True
tasks->
psfgen->

loops->
min_loop_length:
    Minimum length of model-built loop that triggers the ligation
      algorithm
    type: int

tasks->
ligate:
    Specifies how C-termini of modeled loops are connected back to the
      protein
    type: dict
    Help available for steer, connect, minimize
tasks->
ligate->
steer:
    Specifies parameters for steered MD to bring C-termini close to their
      connection points
    type: dict

tasks->
solvate:
    Parameters controlling solvation and ionization
    type: dict

relax:
    Parameters controlling NVT or NPT equilibration
    type: dict
    Help available for ensemble, nminsteps, nsteps, dcdfreq, xstfreq, temperature, pressure
tasks->
relax->
ensemble:
    Name of ensemble to run in; note that NPT can only be peformed on a
      solvated system
    type: str
    default: NVT
    allowed values: NVT, NPT
tasks->
terminate:
    Task that signals end of task list
    type: dict
