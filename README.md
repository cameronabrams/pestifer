# Pestifer
> Automatic NAMD System Input Builder

Pestifer is a Python utility for generating atomistic inputs with appropriate topology and parameter files required for molecular dynamics simulations using NAMD.  It is intended as a fully automated system builder requiring as inputs only the PDB codes of biomolecular structures and a handful of customization parameters.  Pestifer primarily works as a front end for VMD's `psfgen` utility.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pestifer
```

Once installed, the user has access to the main `pestifer` command.
