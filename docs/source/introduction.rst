Introduction
============

``Pestifer`` grew out of my own research in MD simulations of biomolecular systems as a user of VMD and NAMD, and the need to carefully document how systems are generated.  I suspect that ``psfgen`` was developed because the CHARMM program was not freely available but the CHARMM force-field was; this is likely why there are so many of us who think ``psfgen/VMD`` when building systems that use the CHARMM force-field and are run using NAMD.  If you are an experienced CHARMM user, then ``pestifer`` is likely not much use to you, since you think in terms of writing a CHARMM input script (or if you hate writing CHARMM scripts, you use ``pyCHARMM``). If you are a regular user of `Charmm-GUI <https://charmm-gui.org>`_, a server-based interface to the CHARMM PSF-generation routines that can generate production-ready NAMD topology and coordinate inputs, ``pestifer`` offers some advantages.  Unless you are exclusively using coordinates deposited at the `RCSB Protein Data Bank <https://rcsb.org>`_, Charmm-GUI requires you to upload a PDB file to begin the process, and maybe you aren't comfortable with that.  ``pestifer`` does everything on your local machine, so you can build simulation systems based on non-publicly-available PDB structures.
