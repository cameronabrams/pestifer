cleanup
-------

Pestifer provides a subcommand called ``cleanup`` to easily remove files generated by a ``run`` in case you want to start over fresh.  It will remove all files generated by a ``run`` command, including the ``run`` log file, the ``run`` output files, and any temporary files that were created.  It will not remove the original input files (e.g. PSF, DCD, etc.) or any other files that were not generated by the ``run``. It will also not remove any files that are not in the current working directory.

``pestifer cleanup`` requires the name of a ``run`` yaml configuration file.  It will look for the ``run`` output files and temporary files in the same directory as the configuration file.  It will also look for any other files that were generated by the ``run`` command in the same directory.

It will remove all of these files, but will not remove any other files in the directory.
``pestifer cleanup`` is really just a convenient wrapper for the ``rm`` command.

Example: Say you have a ``run`` config file called ``my_run.yaml``.  A simple invocation of ``pestifer cleanup`` might be:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pestifer cleanup my_run.yaml

This will remove all files generated by the ``run`` command that used ``my_run.yaml``, including the ``run`` log file, the ``run`` output files, and any temporary files that were created.  It will not remove the original input files (e.g. PSF, DCD, etc.) or any other files that were not generated by the ``run``. It will also not remove any files that are not in the current working directory.
