Welcome to pestifer's documentation!
====================================

**Pestifer** is a Python package for facilitating the use of the VMD tool ``psfgen``.  It is intended to make generation of initial coordinates for all-atom MD simulations of large proteins easier.  Yes, CHARMM-GUI is nice, but you might not want to upload your coordinates there, right?

.. note::

   Pestifer is under active development.
