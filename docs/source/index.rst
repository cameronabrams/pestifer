Welcome to pestifer's documentation!
====================================

**Pestifer** is a Python package that facilitates the use of the `VMD <https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/>`_ tool `psfgen <https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/psfgen/ug.pdf>`_ to generate CHARMM-force-field compatible PSF and PDB files for use in the MD simulation package `NAMD <https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/>`_.  Pestifer automates and extends the ``psfgen/VMD`` system-building process using a simple YAML interface.

Pestifer includes the CHARMM36 force field files from the `MacKerell Lab <https://mackerell.umaryland.edu/charmm_ff.shtml>`_ (July 2024).  

.. note::

   Pestifer is under active development.  Pestifer development is supported in part by Grants GM100472, AI154071, and AI178833 from the NIH.
