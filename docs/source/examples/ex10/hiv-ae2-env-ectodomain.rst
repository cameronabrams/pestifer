Example 10: Cleaved, Asymmetric HIV-1 AE2 Env Ectodomain Trimer
---------------------------------------------------------------

`PDB ID 8fae <https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8fae>`_ is a structure of the cleaved, asymmetric HIV-1 AE2 Env ectodomain trimer.  Like :ref:`example env ad8`, this structure also contains bound instances of the entry inhibitor model BMS-806 (resname 83G).

The AE2 structure is slightly more compact than the AD8 structure, which is not suprising given that it was developed by introducing stabilizing mutations into the AD8 sequence.  Viruses with both AD8 and AE2 Envs are capable of infecting human cells, and AE2 Env's relatively higher stability makes it more resistant to neutralization by soluble CD4, CD4-mimetic compounds, and cold exposure.
