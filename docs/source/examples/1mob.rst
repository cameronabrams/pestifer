Example 19: Sperm whale myoglobin
---------------------------------

`PDB ID 1mob <https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1mob>`_ is one of 16 structures of sperm whale myoglobin mutants determined by the Phillips lab using X-ray crystallography.  This example demonstrates that pestifer can handle the heme group and the covalent bond between the heme and the His93 residue.  The heme group is a prosthetic group that is not part of the protein sequence, but it is included in the PDB file.  Pestifer can handle this by using the ``psfgen`` task to generate a PSF file that includes the heme group and the covalent bond.
