Example 14: Trimeric HIV-1 gp41 construct embedded in a DHPC/DMPC lipid bilayer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. figure:: pics/my_6e8w_pc.png

           HIV-1 gp41 (MPER-TM) trimer embedded in a DHPC/DMPC lipid bilayer.  Bilayer is clipped to show the protein, and each protein chain is colored uniquely.  DMPC lipids are brown and DHPC (C6) are purple.


`PDB ID 6e8w <https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6e8w>`_ is a trimeric HIV-1 Env gp41 construct embedded in a DHPC/DMPC lipid bilayer. The structure was determined by NMR, and the structure file contains 15 models, and no lipids are included in the file.  This example shows how to use ``pestifer`` to generate a membrane-embedded protein system from this structure.

The key task in this example is the ``make_membrane_system`` task.  This task specifies a ``bilayer`` subtask and an ``embed`` subtask.  The ``bilayer`` subtask specifies the composition of the two leaflets, directives for using ``packmol`` to assemble the initial *minimal* bilayer patch, and relaxation protocols for relaxing the patch and the full-sized bilayer, prior to embedding the protein.  The ``embed`` subtask specifies how the protein is to be oriented and placed in the bilayer.  Immediately following the ``make_membrane_system`` task, the ``minimize`` task is used to relax the system after embedding the protein.  This is then followed by a series of ``md`` tasks to progressively equilibrate the system density and the bilayer area.
