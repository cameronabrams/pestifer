Example 7: The Env SOSIP trimer 4tvp (mmCIF format)
---------------------------------------------------

Many structures in the RCSB are only available in mmCIF format, rather than the old, outdated PDB format.  The SOSIP trimer `4tvp <https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4TVP>`_ is one example.  Fortunately, this is quite easy to handle in pestifer:
