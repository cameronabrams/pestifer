Example 1: Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (BPTI)
-----------------------------------------------------

The Input Configuration
=======================

The ``psfgen`` `user manual <https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/psfgen/ug.pdf>`_ is a necessary resource for learning how to use ``psfgen`` to generate pdb and psf input files for NAMD.  A simple example in that manual is a solvation of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) starting from its PDB coordinates (`PDB ID 6pti <https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6PTI>`_).  ``pestifer`` can reproduce this solvation via the input configuration shown below:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../pestifer/resources/examples/bpti1.yaml
    :language: yaml

You can check the :ref:`config_ref` for a complete reference to Pestifer config files.

This build can be performed (preferably in a clean directory) using this command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pestifer run-example 1

The first thing ``pestifer`` does with ``run-example`` is to copy the YAML config file for that example into the local directory.  In this case, the file copied is named ``bpti1.yaml``, and contains what you see above.  Or, alternatively, pasting that content into a local file ``myconfig.yaml``:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pestifer run myconfig.yaml

You could also use ``fetch-example`` to get the config file and then run it:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ls
  $ pestifer fetch-example 1
  $ ls
  bpti.yaml
  $ pestifer run bpti1

(If there is no extension on the argument of run, pestifer assumes one of ``.yaml``, ``.yml``, or ``.ym``.)

``bpti1.yaml`` is a YAML-format text file, and the keywords (of course) have particular meanings.  This is also an example of a "minimal" configuration file; ``pestifer`` has many more controls that can be set in a configuration file than are shown here.  Here, this configuration file contains two topmost directives: ``title`` and :ref:`config_ref tasks`.  The value of ``title`` is the string ``BPTI`` and the value of ``tasks`` is a *list*.  Each element in the list of tasks is itself a directive describing a task, and ``pestifer`` in general executes tasks in the order they appear in the ``tasks`` list.

Digression: Interactive Help 
============================

``pestifer`` uses the general-purpose package ``ycleptic`` (`pypi <https://pypi.org/project/ycleptic/>`_) to manage its input configurations.  A package developer using ``ycleptic`` specifies a "pattern" file describing the configuration file syntax they would like their package to have.  ``ycleptic`` provides two useful features:

1. Automatic generaton of a hierarchical arrangement of RST files for documentation of all configuration parameters; in these pages, this is rooted at :ref:`config_ref`.
2. Automatic acquisition of a command-line interactive help feature that allows package users to explore the configuration file format specified by the package developers.  

Let's use this second feature to explore the ``psfgen`` task.  (You can visit the :ref:`config_ref tasks psfgen` page to view the same info in the online documentation.)

This tells us that, in addition to ``id``, we have the ability to set several other control parameters.  Continuing in this interactive help session:

.. code-block:: console

  pestifer-help: biological_assembly

  biological_assembly:
      integer index of the biological assembly to construct; default is 0,
        signifying that the asymmetric unit is to be used
      default: 0

  All subdirectives at the same level as 'biological_assembly':

      ! quit
  pestifer-help: 

And so on.  Let's return to the example.  Immediately after the ``psfgen`` task we declare an ``md`` task, and the subdirective ``ensemble`` is set to ``minimize``.  There are no other subdirectives explicitly listed.  This task will use ``namd3`` to run an energy minimization.  As we did for the ``source`` subdirective of the ``psfgen`` task, let's have a look at the possible subdirectives for an ``md`` task.  We can do this by going "up" twice (``source`` to ``psfgen`` to ``tasks``) and then down into the ``md`` task:

.. code-block:: console

The Input Configuration (Continued)
===================================

So let's return to the example.  After the first ``md`` task is the ``solvate`` task.  Notice that it has no subdirectives; in this case default values are used for any subdirectives. After this task has finished, we have a run-ready *nonequilibrated* system.  We equilibrate here using first another minimization via an ``md`` task, then an NVT equilibration in another ``md`` task, and then a series of progressively longer NPT equilibrations in yet more ``md`` tasks.  These "chained-together" NPT runs avoid the common issue that, after solvation, the density of the initial water box is a bit too low, so under pressure control the volume shrinks.  It can shrink so quickly that NAMD's internal data structures for distributing the computational load among processing units becomes invalid, which causes NAMD to die.  The easiest way to reset those internal data structures is just to restart NAMD from the result of the previous run.

The ``mdplot`` task generates a plot of system density (in g/cc) vs time step for the series of MD simulations that occur after solvation.  This is a quick way to check that enough NPT equilibration has been performed.  For this example, the plot looks like this:

.. figure:: pics/solvated-density.png

    Density vs. timestep for the BPTI system post-solvation.

Since the density has plateaued, we can reasonably assume that the system density is equilibrated.

Finally, we see a ``terminate`` task, whose main role is to generate some informative output and to provide a set of NAMD input files (PSF, PDB, xsc, coor, and vel) that all have a common base file name.  The ``package`` subdirective creates a tarball of all required input files to execute a NAMD run, ready for transfer to the HPC resource of your choice.

This run generates a lot of other files.  One such file, ``bpti-complete.yaml`` is the fully explicit configuration file implied by the given configuration file and any default values.  It can be instructive to peruse this file to see the totality of what you can specify for ``pestifer``; it is possible to have very close control over the ``psfgen`` script generation by, for example, adding ``pdbalias`` directives.

The outputs of this build are the PSF/PDB/COOR/VEL/XSC files needed to (re)start namd3; by default, these are ``my_6pti.pdb``, etc.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ls my_6pti*
   my_6pti.coor  my_6pti.pdb  my_6pti.psf  my_6pti.vel  my_6pti.xsc

You should note the presence of CHARMM force-field files in the current directory.  These are generated by ``pestifer`` during the build, and are essentially copies of the parent files with certain lines commented out to permit use by VMD and NAMD.  The parent files are not altered.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ tar ztf prod_6pti.tgz
    prod_6pti.namd
    par_all36_lipid.prm
    toppar_all36_moreions.str
    toppar_all36_prot_modify_res.str
    par_all36_na.prm
    toppar_all36_carb_glycopeptide.str
    par_all36_cgenff.prm
    toppar_water_ions.str
    par_all36m_prot.prm
    par_all36_carb.prm
    00-02-00_solvate.psf
    00-09-00_md-npt.pdb
    00-09-00_md-npt.coor
    00-09-00_md-npt.xsc
    00-09-00_md-npt.vel

The CHARMMFF files that end with ``prm`` and ``str`` are *modified* versions of the as-provided CHARMMFF files from the MacKerrel lab so that NAMD can use them as parameter files.  These are local copies of the files that will work with any NAMD run.  It is important to note that the CHARMMFF files distributed by the MacKerrel lab are not modified AT ALL within pestifer.  ``prod_6pti.namd`` is the namd3 configuration file, and it created with some default values.  Carefully consider its contents before you run; you will need to edit it!

.. _file name conventions:

Digression: On File Name Conventions
====================================

Files generated by pestifer during a build typically conform to a common naming convention:

.. code-block:: bash

   CC-MT-ST-TASKNAME.ext

Here ``CC`` is the 2-digit identification of the run *controller* (e.g., ``00`` for the first controller), ``MT`` is the 2-digit identification of the *main task* of that controller (e.g., ``02`` is the *third* task), and ``ST`` is the 2-digit identification of the *subtask*  of that task(e.g., ``00`` for the first subtasks). ``TASKNAME`` is the name of the task as it appears in the yaml file. ``ext`` is the file extension.  For example, ``00-02-00_solvate.psf`` is the PSF file generated by the ``solvate`` task (the *third* task) in this example.

There were a total of 11 tasks performed in this example, where the final task is the ``terminate`` task.  The final run-ready files therefore have the prefix ``00-09-00`` since they result from the 10th task of the first (and only) controller.

Some tasks may spawn *subcontrollers*, which typically acquire a controller ID derived from that of the parent controller.  In the current version of pestifer, this occurs when building a membrane bilayer, in which a series of MD simulations are launched by a subcontroller the the ``make_membrane_system`` task.
