TcL Scripts and Packages
========================

Pestifer comes with a number of Tcl scripts and packages that are used to prepare systems for molecular dynamics simulations.  These scripts and packages are not intended to be run directly by users, but rather are used by Pestifer's Tcl API.  The procedures they define are available in the Pestifer Tcl API, and can be used in your own VMD scripts.
