This is a list of atom aliases to add to psfgen.  The original list of aliases used by Pestifer is in core/labels.py. Each alias should be a string in the format "ATOM_NAME ALIAS_NAME", where ATOM_NAME is the name of the atom in the PDB file and ALIAS_NAME is the name you want to use in the PSF file.
