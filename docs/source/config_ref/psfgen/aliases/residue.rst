-----------



This is a list of residue aliases to add to psfgen.  The original list of aliases used by Pestifer is in core/labels.py.  Each alias should be a string in the format "RESNAME ALIAS_NAME", where RESNAME is the name of the residue in the PDB file and ALIAS_NAME is the name you want to use in the PSF file.
