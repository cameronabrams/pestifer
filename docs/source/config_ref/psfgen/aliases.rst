.. _config_ref psfgen aliases:

``aliases``
===========

Add any residue or atom aliases needed; this is often done to make sure you have a 4-byte resname for any residue.  These are input as a list of strings, where each string is the full psfgen alias command


Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   aliases:
     atom:
     - ILE CD1 CD
     residue:
     - HIS HSD

Container-like parameters:
