.. _config_ref charmmff:

``charmmff``
============

The ``charmff`` directive informs pestifer which CHARMM force-field parameter and topology files are to be 
used for all psfgen/namd3 executions.  ``standard`` refers to files that are found in the official CHARMMFF 
release, and are referred to by their base filenames, regardless of whether they live in the topmost ``toppar`` 
directory or one of the stream subdirectories.  ``custom`` refers to files that are not part of the official CHARMMFF release.


Single-valued parameter:

  * ``tarball``: Path to a tarball containing the charmmff files; this is used to override the default set of charmmff files
