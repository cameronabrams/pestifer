``source``
==========

Specifies the source of the initial coordinate file

Single-valued parameters:

  * ``biological_assembly``: integer index of the biological assembly to construct; default is 0, signifying that the asymmetric unit is to be used (default: 0)

  * ``transform_reserves``: dictionary keyed by chain IDs in the asymmetric unit with values that are lists of chain ID's for symmetry-related chains in other units of the biological assembly

  * ``remap_chainIDs``: dictionary mapping of chainIDs in structure input to new chainIDs

  * ``reserialize``: If true, resets the serial numbers of all atoms based on their order in the input structure file -- use with caution!! (default: False)

  * ``model``: model number to use if there are multiple models in the file

  * ``cif_residue_map_file``: name of output file to write a mapping of CIF chain-residue number to author chain-residue number-insertion

  * ``include``: Logical expressions used in series to specify those atoms to be included

  * ``exclude``: Logical expressions used in parallel to specify those atoms to be excluded

    Example:

    .. code-block:: yaml
    
       exclude:
         chains:
         - A
         - B
         resnames:
         - YYZ
         - 888
         resseqnums:
         - 100
         - 101
         - 102
         altlocs:
         - A
         - B
