``connection_test``
===================

This test queries for the presence or absence of covalent bonds. 
The general ``interresidue`` test type will count the number of
covalent bonds between atoms on different residues within the
stipulated selection.  The ``disulfide`` test specifically tests
for interresidue bonds between atoms named SG in residues named CYS.
The ``glycosylation`` test will count the number of bonds between
ND2 atoms in the selection and C1 atoms *outside* the selection.


Single-valued attributes:

  * ``name``: User-selected name of this connection test

  * ``selection``: VMD atomselection string defining the selection to be tested

  * ``connection_type``: The type of connection to validate; interresidue, disulfide, or glycosylation

  * ``connection_count``: The expected number of connections in the selection
