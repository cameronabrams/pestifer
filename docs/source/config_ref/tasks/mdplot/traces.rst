``traces``
----------

  * density


The list of energy-like quantities to plot vs timestep.  These quantities are extracted from the NAMD log files and plotted against timestep.  To combine traces onto a single plot, the list element itself can be a list. The default is to plot density, but you can specify any quantity in an ENERGY: output line or an XST file, including:
- density (not included in ENERGY:, but computed)
- a_x (cell size along x direction)
- b_y (cell size along y direction)
- c_z (cell size along z direction)
- pressure
- temperature
