md task for bilayer relaxation

Single-valued parameters:

  * ``ensemble``: Name of ensemble to run in; note that NPT can only be performed on a solvated system (default: minimize)

  * ``nsteps``: Number of MD time steps (or minimization steps if 'ensemble' is 'minimize') (default: 1000)

  * ``temperature``: Temperature (K) for NVT or NPT (default: 300)

  * ``pressure``: Pressure (bar) for NPT; note that NPT can only be performed on a solvated system (default: 1)
