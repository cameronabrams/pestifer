  * ``DIPA``: di-alpha-linoleoyl phosphatidic acid
  * ``DTPA``: di-hexadecatrienoyl phosphatidic acid
  * ``TIPA``: di-palmitoleoyl-2-linoleoyl phosphatidic acid


This directive allows you to specify full names for RESI codes that are used in your custom charmmff files.
This is useful for ensuring that the full names are consistent with the rest of your simulation setup.
