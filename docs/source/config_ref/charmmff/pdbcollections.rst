.. _config_ref charmmff pdbcollections:

``pdbcollections``
------------------



Here you can list one or more paths to PDB collections that you have built using the ``make-pdb-collection`` subcommand.  
These collections can be used to provide custom lipids or ligands for your simulations.  
The paths should point to directories that contain subdirectories for each RESI in the collection, 
each of which contains PDB files for that RESI.


Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   charmff:
     pdbcollections:
     - /path/to/my/custom/lipid/collection/
     - /path/to/my/custom/ligand/collection/
